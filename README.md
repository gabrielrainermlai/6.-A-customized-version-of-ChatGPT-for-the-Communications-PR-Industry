# 6.-A-customized-version-of-ChatGPT-for-the-Communications-PR-Industry
#The last time the PR industry was disrupted was the launch of Microsoft Word. 

#The last time the PR industry was disrupted was the launch of Microsoft Word. It's a very analog sector, and most of the work products are basic -- but still customized -- pieces of writing: press releases, op-eds, media advisories. ChatGPT can produce drafts of these, but they still aren't specific enough to be useful for an individual or a company. By developing a customized version of ChatGPT -- one which effectively guides the user through inputting the right documents and content -- I hope to build a program automates much of the basic writing in the communications sector.

#A simple interface where non-technical users can input relevant documents (.doc and google doc files) and guidance that will allow the customized version of GPT-3 to output more personalized and relevant writing
#Ideally, I would also like to explore how a voice-to-text function could be plugged in. For instance, could a file from a service like Otter.ai or Rev.com be used as an input
